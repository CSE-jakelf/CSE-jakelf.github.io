[We split our Affinity Diagram into 5 sections: Product Ideas, Hurdles/Challenges, Technology, Sharing, and Miscellaneous.  To further explain these 5 categories, product ideas are essentailly ways to solves our problem, hurdles are potential problems, technology is what devices/innovation is needed for our solution, sharing is the accessibility of our product, and miscellaneous is other ideas we had.]
